# FIR-Filter-Design-using-Distributed-Arithmetic
FIR filter is a filter response to any finite length input in a finite duration, because it settles to zero in finite time. Generally FIR filter consists of Multipliers, Adders, Delay elements. The previous work done mainly focuses on the design using the same devices.
The proposed model mainly enhances FIR filter performance by designing it using distributed arithmetic of a 3-dimensional lookup table in place of the multiplier. This design can be implemented using software's like MATLAB & Xilinx.
